/* Study Drill
1. Change the code so that it uses a while loop instead of a do-while loop.
Make sure it compiles and works the same.

A: ln 9-38

2. Change it back to a do-while loop. (You might look back at this code
later when you forget how to write a do-while loop and we donâ€™t want your
only example to have been changed to a while loop.)

A: I just commented out the original code and left my own while loop active
